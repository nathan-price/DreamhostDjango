# DreamhostDjango
### Scripts to automate setting up a Django website on Dreamhost

## Prerequisites:
1. A Dreamhost account with hosting plan
2. The ability to ssh into your Dreamhost server
   [(If you are on Windows I recommend using Bitvise SSH Client)](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download)
3. A fully hosted domain/subdomain **with Passenger enabled**
4. A MySQL Database (found in Goodies > MySQL Databases)
   Make sure you know the hostname for database (the url), as well as the name of the database, and a username and password with access to the database.
